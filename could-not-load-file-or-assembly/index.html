This article is about how to solve the dll conflicts while adding OfficePnP nuget to your solution.</p>

<p><strong>What is the problem</strong>?</p>

<p>Most of the cases, we may want to utilize the OfficePnP solution customize our SharePoint sites. Recently I was working on project where I had to create modern sharepoint team sites and then add modern webparts like Welcome text, Highlighted Content , Quick links with static content etc as part of provisioning (if anyone interested in this solution, please leave a comment). In this case, I have built a custom solution and then added OfficePnP nuget to manage the modern pages.</p>

<p>When I built the project, I was getting lot of issues with error message could not load file or assembly&#8230;â€¦ . This was happening for almost all the Dlls which are common in OfficePnP and my solution</p>

<p><strong>How can we solve this</strong> ?</p>

<p>The simplest solution for this is to add the nuget to the custom project where OfficePnP is referred. For eg:- When you run your project say it throws error &#8220;Could not load file or assembly System.Net.http 4.1.1&#8230;..&#8221; , stop the execution and add the nuget package System.Net.Http 4.1.1 or latest to your project. Build again and execute and you can see that the error disappeared. You may have to repeat this for all the other dlls which throws this error.</p>
